Alrighty here, gather 'round... Let me tell you a little story. This story yet; is no simple story, but one of a 2D modeler. A 2D modeler that could but shouldn't, that did but wouldn't. That 2D modeler was by the strongest band of adventurers known throughout the land... And that group was simply the Scum of the Earth

All of the UML diagrams were written with draw.io and are in xml format
